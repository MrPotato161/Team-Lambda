Well, that exact logo was featured in a game called Half-Life and Half-Life 2. In Half-Life 2, the Resistance featured in the game uses this exact logo, a Lambda. A lambda is simply a letter in the Greek alphabet, but to Team Lambda, it's seen as a symbol of resistance and hope because of our common love for the Half-Life series. A resistance against the common belief that you can't have fun at school."},{"page":"services.html","anchor":"features01-1q","header":"Services","body":"Windows 98 A game website featuring many games and apps made in Google Sites.
